### **Homophobia and Misogyny in Rap and Hip Hop**

In this project, the use of homophobic and misogynistic slurs in rap and hip hop music over time is studied. Specifically, I analyzed how the frequency of homophobic and misogynistic slurs in rap and hip hop music has changed over time, ranging from 1984 to 2018.
